// The Patients cluster's own root — list ⇄ record ⇄ editor. There is still no
// navigator (SPEC §18 F3), but the routes above the list are a real stack now
// (`src/navigation`), so back is `pop` and the chevron calls the same function.
// Every screen is already written against `onOpen(patientId)`, `onBack()` and
// `onSaved(patientId)`. The shell (`src/shell`) mounts this as the Patients tab.
//
// The list is the root and stays mounted underneath, which is what keeps its
// scroll and its search text while a record is being read. Everything above it
// is a pane on `ui/PushView`, drawn from the stack.
//
// A record can also be asked for from outside — the doctor's day view opens one
// off an appointment — and a patient's record is the Patients tab's screen, so
// the shell switches tabs and passes the request down here rather than each
// cluster drawing its own copy inside its own tab. `open` is the request, not the
// route: it carries a `seq` so asking for the same patient twice re-opens the
// record after it has been backed out of, and `backLabel` says where back goes
// in the caller's words. It lands through `resetTo`, because a jump from another
// tab has nothing on the way out worth watching leave.
//
// The traffic runs the other way too: the record's Book and Walk-in both land
// in a cluster this one cannot reach, so they are handed back up to the shell
// with the patient and nothing else. `goHome` comes down the same wire — the
// shell cannot pop a route it does not own, so it says only that the tab was
// tapped, and here that is `popToRoot`.
//
// The editor is reachable from both screens and returns to whichever asked for
// it. That used to need a `from` field on the route; the stack already knows
// what is underneath, so it does not. Saving does not simply go back —
// registering someone lands on the record that now exists, and correcting one
// returns to the record it was opened from with `read` bumped, so the screen
// remounts and re-reads rather than showing what it held before the write.
