/**
 * SPEC §10:
 *
 *     balance = visits.charged_total - COALESCE(SUM(payments.amount), 0)
 *
 * Derived, never stored. There is no unpaid status — a payment is a row, not a
 * state transition — so every figure here is computed at read time.
 *
 * In `summary`, charged is attributed to the visit's appointment date while
 * collected is attributed to the day the money arrived, which is why the two
 * are counted separately rather than differenced per visit. `to` is inclusive
 * as a date, so the range ends at the start of the following day.
 *
 * `outstanding` and `byPatient` count opening balances — money carried over
 * from the old system is still owed, and a patient's total has to say so.
 * `summary` does not: see the note on its charged query.
 *
 * `settle` is the one write here, and the only way a payment is taken in the
 * app. It is against a *patient*: the money is allocated over their unsettled
 * visits oldest-first and written as ordinary `payments` rows, so every read
 * above keeps working unchanged and no balance is ever stored.
