/**
 * SPEC §7. Double-booking is prevented by Postgres (§5); this service's job is
 * to turn SQLSTATE 23P01 into `SLOT_OVERLAP` so the client can say something
 * useful, and to keep the reminder row in step with the appointment.
 *
 * Missed appointments are never transitioned on a timer — they are listed for
 * someone to resolve (§7).
 *
 * `insertWithRef` retries only when the generated `ref` collided; an overlap is
 * a real answer there and is not retried. Every path that writes a span takes
 * `lockDay` first, so the planners queue rather than deadlock, and the walk-in
 * alone retries the whole transaction on the residue (`retryOnStaleDay`) —
 * being refused for want of room is the one answer a walk-in may not get.
 * The walk-in path imports the visit module
 * lazily to avoid an import cycle (visit reads appointments). `awaitPayment`
 * repeats the status in the UPDATE's predicate, so the write itself decides: a
 * checkout committing `done` in between would otherwise leave a settled visit
 * stuck in `awaiting_payment` with no way back.
 *
 * A booking carries the procedures the secretary expects (§7). They are
 * validated against §5 before the transaction opens — reads against reference
 * data, and the checks are about the request, not the booking — and written by
 * `replaceProcedures`, whose `sortOrder` preserves the entered order, which is
 * the order check-in seeds visit lines in. `procedures` must be destructured
 * out of `update`'s patch: it is a separate table and would corrupt `set()`.
 * Omitting it leaves the list alone, an empty array clears it (§13). Reads
 * batch the catalogue join once per page rather than once per row.
